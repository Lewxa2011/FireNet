# FireNet
Realtime Multiplayer for Unity 3D using Firebase's Realtime-Database.
Copy of Pun 2 (without the closed source payment part)

# NOTICE!
If not obvious, I got lazy at points and used AI to run through the code and do stuff.
A good majority is my stuff, but if you see comments riddled through the code everywhere just know that lol

# Requirements
Firebase Account with a Firebase App with Realtime-Database and Authentication (EMAIL and password auth option enabled)

# WIP!!!
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
Has bugs.
Needs optimization.
Code isn't formatted very well, sorry lol.
Needs XML docs! Might just use one of those AI doc writers, im not rlly wanting to write docs :(
