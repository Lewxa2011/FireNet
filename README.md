3. Set your Firebase Realtime-Database rules to the rules in firebaserules.json

4. ENSURE there is a gameobject with the FireNetwork component in the scene!

# NOTICE!
If not obvious, I got lazy at points and used AI to run through the code and do stuff. (hence the ugly comments everywhere)

# WIP!!!
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
Has bugs.
Needs optimization.
Code isn't formatted very well, sorry lol.
Needs XML docs! Might just use one of those AI doc writers, im not rlly wanting to write docs :(
